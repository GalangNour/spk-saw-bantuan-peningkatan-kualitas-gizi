<h2>Background</h2>
Providing nutritional aid effectively requires careful consideration of multiple factors such as nutritional content, cost, availability, and beneficiaries' needs. The Simple Additive Weighting method is a multi-criteria decision-making approach that allows for the evaluation of various options based on assigned weights and criteria. This project leverages SAW to facilitate better decision-making in distributing nutritional aid.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Criteria-Based Evaluation: Allows for the evaluation of nutritional aid packages based on multiple criteria.</li>
  <li>Weight Assignment: Users can assign weights to each criterion based on their importance.</li>
  <li>Ranking of Options: The system ranks the aid packages based on their overall scores calculated using the SAW method.</li>
  <li>User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for entering data and viewing results.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PHP 8: Used for application logic and server-side processing.</li>
  <li>MySQL: Used for storing data related to nutritional aid packages, criteria, and weights.</li>
  <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for developing the user interface.</li>
</ul>
